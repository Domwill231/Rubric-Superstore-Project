# Rubric-Superstore-Project
The project task was to study the sales and return rate of the store and determine which stores 
and regions were the most profiable. Another task was to, find what states advertising would be 
beneficial and which customers had the highest return rate. By comparing profits and loses, we were
able to not only find what region was profitable, but also what items were causing the company to take a loss.
By discontinuing those items or finding another wholesaler to purchase quality items from, we may be ale 
to turn a profit on those items.
